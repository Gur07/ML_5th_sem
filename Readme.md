# Machine Learning (5th Semester) – Coursework Repository  

## 📖 Overview  
Welcome to my **5th Semester Machine Learning Repository**!   
It serves as a structured collection of all course-related materials, including:  
- Lecture notes and references  
- Assignments and lab exercises  
- Implemented codes for algorithms  
- Mini-projects and case studies  
- Documentation (data cards, decision logs, reports)  

The purpose of this repository is to provide an **organized academic record** of the learning process, while also serving as a reference for future work in the field of Machine Learning.

## 📑 Course Coverage  
The repository will gradually include:  
1. **Supervised Learning** – Regression, Classification (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, etc.)  
2. **Unsupervised Learning** – Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, K-Means, etc.)  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Feature selection, scaling, encoding.  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Cross-validation, metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC).  
5. **Advanced Topics** – Ensemble methods, Neural Networks basics.  
6. **Projects** – Case studies on real datasets like Titanic survival prediction, digit recognition, etc.
